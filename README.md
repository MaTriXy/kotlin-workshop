A Kotlin workshop intended to be taught in two days. 

### Structure

This workshop is divided into two parts

* Introduction to Kotlin
* Advanced Kotlin

It consists of 

* **Instructor Project**: Used to explain concepts, with existing code samples
* **Student Project**: For students to complete
* **[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zYWyDedyf0YhnLFF3TVpUqU3C8PKTuvR5P06L99MRn8/edit?usp=sharing)**: For the instructor to use 
* **[Questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XO87ugZHS_gNyEXyoUbqK13bMYLaXWXfwKknNTkMf00/edit?usp=sharing)**: For students to complete


Both the Instructor Project and the slides have Introduction and Advanced modules included. While the Introduction 
has a lot of pre-built examples, it also serves as a canvas to show more code while teaching. However, please make sure that if you're 
a contributing author to this project, that you *do not* check-in any ad-hoc code. It's also recommended to use Scratch files in IntelliJ IDEA
for this purpose.
